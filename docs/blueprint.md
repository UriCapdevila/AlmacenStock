- Background color: Very light gray (#F9FAFB), nearly white, to provide a clean, neutral backdrop and maximize contrast with content.
- Accent color: Pale blue (#A7CBDB) to complement the primary color while providing clear visual separation. It should create a focus effect on the grid elements.

- Minimalist layout with a clear focus on data presentation and quick actions.
- Lucide React icons used throughout for a consistent and modern look.
